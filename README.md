## I aim to power democracies, big and small, by combining the power of crowdfunding, tokenized incentives and blockchain-based voting to create powerful, effective communities.
 
- Money talks when it comes to politics. For years, much of the power over political campaigns and issues has been concentrated in the hands of wealthy people who give thousands and millions to the campaigns of their favorite candidates. But we haven't given up. Recently that's been changing. Smaller campaign donations from a broader swath of the electorate have been playing a larger role, thanks to new online fund-raising tools. But that smaller group of big donors still holds an outsize influence over policy priorities once the elections are over. The elected politicians listen more closely to “the people writing the big checks,” which means that the issues and causes most important to small donors often “get lost in translation.” 

- I believe a blockchain can help. A combination of crowdfunding, blockchain voting, and cryptocurrency-based incentives are enough to give small donors a more powerful voice in politics. **The application I propose is a fund-raising platform meant to allow ordinary people to raise money around issues or causes and then vote on where it goes.**

- At the core of system will be an Ethereum-based cryptocurrency. The site will grant users a certain number of tokens when they sign up. The tokens can be used to perform various actions on the platform. For instance, to start a fund-raising campaign, called a “movement,”  a user must lock up (or “stake,” in blockchain parlance) 10 tokens. Movements can be started around specific policy issues. If a movement grows in terms of supporters and pledges, the person who started it will earn more tokens and, in turn, more influence.

- Users can also suggest politicians running for federal office to whom they think a given movement should contribute. People can then vote on those suggestions to decide whether to donate. Suggesting and voting on politicians cost tokens. When the voting is over, a third-party payment processor will distribute the money to the winning candidates. I hope that eventually the platform will be popular enough for politicians to start competing for these awards.

- The application will generate revenue by taking a 4.75% fee on top of donations, similar to crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter. The target users are voters who put a premium on transparency in politics, particularly millennials.

 - You don't need to be a super lobbyist, an operative or corporation to make real change happen. All you need is a cause and a bunch of people ready to pledge a small amount to support it. We're fixing our broken system with more democracy. 
 
- I aim to create a platform allowing anyone to convert their friends, family, and/or followers into effective and powerful interest groups for the political issues or causes that matter to them.
